# About Me

I'm Soheil Shapouri, an evolutionary and cross-cultural psychologist with a passion for understanding how ecological threats shape cultures and influence emotions and social behaviors. My true love, however, is exploring new statistical techniques. Lately, I've been diving into the challenge of non-independent data points using machine learning, Bayesian, and frequentist appraoches. In long term, I aim to bridge the gap between theory-driven psychology and data-driven computer science.
