# About Me

I'm Soheil Shapouri, a postdoctoral fellow at UCLA with a passion for understanding how ecological threats such as infecious diseases, natural disasters, and technogical catasrophies shape who we are, what we feel, and how we live together. My true love, however, is learning new statistical techniques. In the long term, I aim to bridge the gap between theory-driven social sciences and data-driven computer science.
