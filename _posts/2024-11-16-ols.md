We want to model collectivism (GCI) based on ecological threats (i.e., natural disasters, epidemics) and national wealth (GDP). Let's get the data:
  
```r  
ecodata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soheilshapouri/epidemics_collectivism/main/Data%20S2.csv")
```
If we have more predictors than observations, we will switch to regilarized regression. But that is not the case here so we move on to train-test split. 
```r
set.seed(123)  
index <- sample(nrow(ecodata), round(nrow(ecodata)*0.8))  
eco_train <- ecodata[index, ]  
eco_test <- ecodata[-index, ]  
```
