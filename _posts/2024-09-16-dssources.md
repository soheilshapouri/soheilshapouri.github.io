Resources for data science are anything but scarce. However, finding concise, to-the-point, useful, and thought-provoking resources isn’t as common as one might think. Below, I’ve curated a list of resources that I find succinct, straightforward, practical, and stimulating. The list follows, roughly, the order in which research might be conducted and covers a broad scope of data science topics, from hypothesis testing to NLP and machine learning.

_This post will be updated periodically as I discover new gems._
