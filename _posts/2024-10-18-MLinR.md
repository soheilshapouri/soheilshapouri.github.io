To ensure the generalizability of the model, we split the data into training and testing sets, using the former to train the model and the latter to test it.  

```r  
set.seed(123)  
index <- sample(nrow(ecodata), round(nrow(ecodata)*0.8))  
training <- ecodata[index, ]  
test <- ecodata[-index, ]  
```
A train-test split can be performed using the caret, h2o, and rsample packages. However, the main challenge is often ensuring the outcome variable (DV) has the same distribution in both the training and test sets.
